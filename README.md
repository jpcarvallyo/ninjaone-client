## How to get started

- Be sure to install node modules within the root of the project via your terminal:
  `npm install`
- When running the backend for this project [backend for this project ](https://github.com/NinjaMSP/devicesTask_serverApp)
  > - Take note of the port that you are running the backend on. By default the frontend is looking for port 3000 in regards to the API calls but if you want to modify that, here are the steps:
       - Navigate to the **.env** file at the root of the project. I hard coded the api url to http://localhost:3000. You could change that to be in alignment with the port you're running the backend locally or if it's hosted somewhere online, you could point to that as well.
- When you want to run the application. Enter:
  `npm run start`

## How to Test

If you want to run the test suite. Type the follow in the terminal:

    npm run test
